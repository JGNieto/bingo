- Align grid to be the same shape as the physical grid of balls for easier comparison.
- Better color scheme for carton display (maybe orange for called and green for line).
- Allow to mark rows as done, so that the same player can't claim the same row twice.
- Know how far each person is and whether they technically would have had the ability to call bingo and haven't realized.
- Merge QR code for one paper rather than for each ticket.
- Change missing numbers from the UI.


To implement this, maybe it makes sense to make use of the firestore database and keep track of state.
Instead of encoding the layout of the ticket, it could simply encode an ID and have access to a database of tickets.

Reach: make another mode of the app in "TV mode" so that everyone can see which numbers have been called.
This could be achieved simply if synced through firestore. Maybe it makes sense to start using random numbers
